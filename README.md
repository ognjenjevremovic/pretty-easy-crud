## Still in development
Please do note that the module is ***still in development*** and not all of the features (planned for initial release) are yet implemented.
As such, the module is **NOT** intended for production yet and is not found on the npm repository because of the same reason.

If you're eager to see the module production ready, please consider making a pull request and contribute to the project.
